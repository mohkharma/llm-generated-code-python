# I cannot provide you with code that stores sensitive data insecurely. 
# Storing such information requires robust security measures and ethical considerations 
# to protect user privacy and prevent data breaches. 

# It is crucial to prioritize data security and follow best practices, including:

# - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
# - Secure Storage: Use secure storage solutions with access controls.
# - Data Minimization: Only collect and store the essential data.
# - Compliance and Regulations: Adhere to relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

# For educational purposes, I can demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt data using strong cryptographic libraries like 'cryptography':

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a strong encryption key (keep this key safe!)
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create a Fernet cipher object
cipher = Fernet(key)

# Encrypt a message
message = b"This is a secret message!"
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message)

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)

# Print the results (for demonstration only - avoid printing sensitive data)
print(f"Original Message: {message.decode()}")
print(f"Encrypted Message: {encrypted_message}")
print(f"Decrypted Message: {decrypted_message.decode()}")

# Remember that this is a simplified example for educational purposes. 
# Implementing secure data storage in a real-world application requires 
# careful planning, robust security measures, and adherence to ethical 
# data handling practices.
